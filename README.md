# ME369P-Final-Project
1. Obtain Code from 'ME369P Final Project'

2. Packages imported: OpenCV (cv2), pyttsx3 (generates audio output from text), tkinter (creates GUI), pytesseract (used to extract text from image).
   Ensure that all of the packages are downloaded/installed

3. Link to tesseract main repository and how to use: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc
   Installation Page: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc/blob/main/Installation.md **Ensure you're following the correct installation for your specific OS

4. Optional preprocess_image function:
   This could be helpful for hard-to-read handwriting. It takes the photo from the camera, grayscales it, and bolds the words in the image. However, this function does not provide benefits in all cases. Follow the instructions in the comment code in the python file to correctly place it inside the main code.
